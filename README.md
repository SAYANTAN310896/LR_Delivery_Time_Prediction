# LR_Delivery_Time_Prediction

##### Objectives

<h5>The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model capable of predicting the delivery time for orders placed through Porter. This involves utilizing various features such as ordered items, restaurant location, order protocol, and delivery partner availability.</h5> 

###### Key goals include:

•	Predicting order delivery time based on multiple input features.
•	Improving delivery time predictions to optimize operational efficiency.
•	Understanding the crucial factors influencing delivery time to enhance model accuracy.
